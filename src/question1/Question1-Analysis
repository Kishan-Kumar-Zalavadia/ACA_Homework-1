Question-1:
Based on the provided data, let's analyze the behavior of the data structures (Binary Min Heap, AVL Tree, and Splay Tree) and discuss which type of problems they are most suitable for:

**1. Building Time:**

- Binary Min Heap has the lowest mean building time (2.51 million nanoseconds), which indicates that it's efficient for constructing the data structure. This makes it suitable for applications where you need to frequently build or update the structure.

- AVL Tree has a mean building time of 13.45 million nanoseconds, which is higher than the heap but still reasonable. AVL trees maintain balanced structures, so they are suitable for applications where you need to maintain a sorted or balanced data structure.

- Splay Tree has a slightly higher mean building time (around 14.11 million nanoseconds) compared to the AVL Tree. It's still reasonable for many applications, especially if you expect frequent searches and modifications. Splay trees can adapt to access patterns over time, potentially making them suitable for dynamic data.

**2. Search Time for Lowest Numbers:**

- Binary Min Heap has a relatively low mean search time for the lowest numbers (12,367 nanoseconds). Heaps are suitable for applications where you need quick access to the minimum or maximum element in a dataset, like priority queues.

- AVL Tree has a higher mean search time for the lowest numbers (22,691.6 nanoseconds), indicating that AVL trees may not be the most efficient choice for this specific operation.

- Splay Tree has the lowest mean search time for the lowest numbers (11,633.6 nanoseconds). Splay trees adapt to access patterns, which can make them well-suited for frequently accessed elements, especially the lowest values.

**3. Search Time for Random Numbers:**

- Binary Min Heap has the highest mean search time for random numbers (3.73 million nanoseconds). Heaps are not optimized for arbitrary element retrieval and are better suited for priority queue scenarios.

- AVL Tree has a lower mean search time for random numbers (9,891.2 nanoseconds). AVL trees are efficient for searching in a balanced tree structure.

- Splay Tree has the lowest mean search time for random numbers (3,091.4 nanoseconds), which indicates their adaptability to access patterns. They are suitable for applications with unpredictable access patterns.

**4. Insertion Time:**

- Binary Min Heap has the lowest mean insertion time (98,908.2 nanoseconds), which makes it suitable for applications where you need efficient insertions.

- AVL Tree has a higher mean insertion time (967,574.8 nanoseconds). AVL trees are more suitable when the tree structure needs to remain balanced during insertions.

- Splay Tree has a mean insertion time of 956,208.4 nanoseconds. While not the fastest, it's still reasonable for many applications, especially those that require frequent insertions and deletions.

In summary, the choice of data structure depends on the specific requirements of your application:

- Use Binary Min Heap when you need efficient construction, quick access to the minimum or maximum element, and fast insertions.

- Use AVL Trees when you need a balanced and sorted data structure, and your application doesn't require frequent access to the minimum or maximum elements.

- Use Splay Trees when your application has dynamic access patterns, unpredictable search and insertion needs, and you want a self-adjusting tree structure.
